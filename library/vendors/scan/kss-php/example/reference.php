<p>This block above was created with a simple php block:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
    foreach ($kss->getSectionChildren($reference) as $section) {
        require('includes/block.inc.php');
    }
?&gt;</code></pre>

    Take a look at the source code for more details. The goal is to remove
    the pain from creating a styleguide â€” document your CSS, have example
    HTML in your templates and automate as much as possible.

<?php
    require_once('includes/footer.inc.php');
